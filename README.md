## Welcome!

This is a fun repo for showing the daft good fun that can be had with pygame.

Hopefully Will has gone through some of these things with you, or this is going to look quite inexplicable.

you can get started with the [Spelling Bee](./spelling_bee/a_spelling_bee.py) or you can tackle the edited [Space Invaders](./space_invaders/space_invaders_edited.py)

If you need some inspiration you can have fun with the working [Coach Invaders](./space_invaders/space_invaders_working.py).


Enjoy!
